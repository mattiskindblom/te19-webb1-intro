    <h2>Chapter I</h2>
    <h4>
        <p> May. Bistritz.—Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late.</p> <p> seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets.</p> <p>I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible.</p> <p> impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of</p> <p>noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.

We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.</p> <p>Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty.</p> <p>(Mem., get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere</p> <p>along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.</p>
